1) incremental

	- insertion sort
	
2) divide and conquer

	- merge sort
	- find maximum subarray
	- Strassen's algorithm for multiplying square matrices
	
3) optimization problems

	3.1. dynamic programming
	
		- rod cutting (Serling Enterprises buys long steel rods and cuts them into shorter rods, which it then sells.) O(n^2) running time.
		- matrix-chain multiplication O(n^3) running time.
		- longest common subsequence
		- optimal binary search trees
		- Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which finds shortest paths between all pairs of vertices
	
	3.2. greedy algorithms
	
		- an activity-selection problem
