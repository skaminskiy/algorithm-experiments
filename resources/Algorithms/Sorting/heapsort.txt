Like merge sort,
but unlike insertion sort, heapsort’s running time is O(nlgn). Like insertion sort,
but unlike merge sort, heapsort sorts in place: only a constant number of array
elements are stored outside the input array at any time.

Heapsort also introduces another algorithm design technique: using a data structure,
in this case one we call a “heap,” to manage information.

Heapsort is an excellent algorithm, but a good implementation of quicksort, usually beats it in practice.
