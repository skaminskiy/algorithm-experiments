Just as we can model a road map as a directed graph in order to find the shortest
path from one point to another, we can also interpret a directed graph as a “flow
network” and use it to answer questions about material flows.
Flow networks can model many problems, including liquids flowing through pipes,
parts through assembly lines, current through electrical networks, and information
through communication networks.

1) The Ford-Fulkerson method. We call it a “method” rather than an “algorithm” because it encompasses
several implementations with differing running times. The Ford-Fulkerson method
depends on three important ideas that transcend the method and are relevant to
many flow algorithms and problems: residual networks, augmenting paths, and
cuts.

2) The Edmonds-Karp algorithm. We call the Ford-Fulkerson method so implemented the
Edmonds-Karp algorithm. We now prove that the Edmonds-Karp algorithm runs
in O(VE^2) time.

3) Push-relabel algorithms. To date, many of the asymptotically fastest maximum-flow algorithms are
push-relabel algorithms, and the fastest actual implementations of maximum-flow
algorithms are based on the push-relabel method. Push-relabel methods also efficiently
solve other flow problems, such as the minimum-cost flow problem. This
section introduces Goldberg’s “generic” maximum-flow algorithm, which has a
simple implementation that runs in O((V^2)E) time, thereby improving upon the
O(VE^2) bound of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.

4) The relabel-to-front algorithm.
