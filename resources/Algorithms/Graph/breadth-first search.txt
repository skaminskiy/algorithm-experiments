Given a graph G = (V,E) and a distinguished source vertex s, breadth-first
search systematically explores the edges of G to “discover” every vertex that is
reachable from s. It computes the distance (smallest number of edges) from s
to each reachable vertex. It also produces a “breadth-first tree” with root s that
contains all reachable vertices. For any vertex  reachable from s, the simple path
in the breadth-first tree from s to  corresponds to a “shortest path” from s to 
in G, that is, a path containing the smallest number of edges. The algorithm works
on both directed and undirected graphs.

Running time of the BFS procedure is O(V+E). Thus, breadth-first
search runs in time linear in the size of the adjacency-list representation of G.
