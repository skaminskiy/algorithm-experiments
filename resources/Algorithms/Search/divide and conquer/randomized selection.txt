The general selection problem appears more difficult than the simple problem of
finding a minimum. Yet, surprisingly, the asymptotic running time for both problems
is the same: Big Theta(n).

As in quicksort, we partition the input array
recursively. But unlike quicksort, which recursively processes both sides of the
partition, RANDOMIZED-SELECT works on only one side of the partition.

The worst-case running time for RANDOMIZED-SELECT is Big Theta(n^2), even to find
the minimum, because we could be extremely unlucky and always partition around
the largest remaining element, and partitioning takes Big Theta(n) time.
The algorithm has a linear expected running time, though, and because it is randomized,
no particular input elicits the worst-case behavior.
