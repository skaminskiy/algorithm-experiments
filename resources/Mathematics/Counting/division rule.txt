THE DIVISION RULE There are n/d ways to do a task if it can be done using a procedure
that can be carried out in n ways, and for every way w, exactly d of the n ways correspond
to way w.

How many different ways are there to seat four people around a circular table, where two
seatings are considered the same when each person has the same left neighbor and the same
right neighbor?

Solution: We arbitrarily select a seat at the table and label it seat 1. We number the rest of the
seats in numerical order, proceeding clockwise around the table. Note that are four ways to
select the person for seat 1, three ways to select the person for seat 2, two ways to select the
person for seat 3, and one way to select the person for seat 4. Thus, there are 4! = 24 ways to
order the given four people for these seats. However, each of the four choices for seat 1 leads
to the same arrangement, as we distinguish two arrangements only when one of the people has
a different immediate left or immediate right neighbor. Because there are four ways to choose
the person for seat 1, by the division rule there are 24/4 = 6 different seating arrangements of
four people around the circular table.
