Suppose that a task can be done in one of two ways, but some of the ways to do it are common
to both ways. In this situation, we cannot use the sum rule to count the number of ways to do
the task.

THE SUBTRACTION RULE If a task can be done in either n1 ways or n2 ways, then the
number of ways to do the task is n1 + n2 minus the number of ways to do the task that are
common to the two different ways.

How many bit strings of length eight either start with a 1 bit or end with the two bits 00?

Solution: We can construct a bit string of length eight that either starts with a 1 bit or ends
with the two bits 00, by constructing a bit string of length eight beginning with a 1 bit or by
constructing a bit string of length eight that ends with the two bits 00. We can construct a bit
string of length eight that begins with a 1 in 27 = 128 ways. This follows by the product rule,
because the first bit can be chosen in only one way and each of the other seven bits can be
chosen in two ways. Similarly, we can construct a bit string of length eight ending with the two
bits 00, in 26 = 64 ways. This follows by the product rule, because each of the first six bits can
be chosen in two ways and the last two bits can be chosen in only one way.
Some of the ways to construct a bit string of length eight starting with a 1 are the same
as the ways to construct a bit string of length eight that ends with the two bits 00. There are
25 = 32 ways to construct such a string. This follows by the product rule, because the first
bit can be chosen in only one way, each of the second through the sixth bits can be chosen
in two ways, and the last two bits can be chosen in one way. Consequently, the number of
bit strings of length eight that begin with a 1 or end with a 00, which equals the number
of ways to construct a bit string of length eight that begins with a 1 or that ends with 00,
equals 128 + 64 âˆ’ 32 = 160.
