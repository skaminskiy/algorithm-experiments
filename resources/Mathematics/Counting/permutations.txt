Let S = {a, b, c}. The 2-permutations of S are the ordered arrangements
a, b; a, c; b, a; b, c; c, a; and c, b. Consequently, there are six 2-permutations of this set
with three elements. There are always six 2-permutations of a set with three elements. There
are three ways to choose the first element of the arrangement. There are two ways to choose the
second element of the arrangement, because it must be different from the first element. Hence,
by the product rule, we see that P(3, 2) = 3 * 2 = 6. the first element. By the product rule, it
follows that P(3, 2) = 3 * 2 = 6.

We now use the product rule to find a formula for P(n, r) whenever n and r are positive integers
with 1 ≤ r ≤ n.

THEOREM: If n is a positive integer and r is an integer with 1 ≤ r ≤ n, then there are
P(n, r) = n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · (n − r + 1)
r-permutations of a set with n distinct elements.

COROLLARY: If n and r are integers with 0 ≤ r ≤ n, then P(n, r) = n! / (n − r)! 


Permutations with repetition:

How many strings of length r can be formed from the uppercase letters of the English alphabet?

Solution: By the product rule, because there are 26 uppercase English letters, and because each
letter can be used repeatedly, we see that there are 26^r strings of uppercase English letters of
length r.

THEOREM: The number of r-permutations of a set of n objects with repetition allowed is n^r


Permutations with Indistinguishable Objects:

How many different strings can be made by reordering the letters of the word SUCCESS?

Solution: Because some of the letters of SUCCESS are the same, the answer is not given by the
number of permutations of seven letters. This word contains three Ss, two Cs, one U, and one E.
To determine the number of different strings that can be made by reordering the letters, first note
that the three Ss can be placed among the seven positions in C(7, 3) different ways, leaving four 
positions free. Then the two Cs can be placed in C(4, 2) ways, leaving two free positions. The U
can be placed in C(2, 1) ways, leaving just one position free. Hence E can be placed in C(1, 1)
way. Consequently, from the product rule, the number of different strings that can be made is

C(7, 3)C(4, 2)C(2, 1)C(1, 1) = (7!/(3!*4!))*(4!/(2!*2!))*(2!/(1!*1!))*(1!/(1!*0!))
= 7!/(3!*2!*1!*1!) = 420

THEOREM: The number of different permutations of n objects, where there are n1 indistinguishable
objects of type 1, N2 indistinguishable objects of type 2, . . . , and Nk indistinguishable objects
of type k, is

n!/(n1!*n2! · · · nk!)
