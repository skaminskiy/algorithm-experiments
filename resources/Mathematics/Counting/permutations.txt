Let S = {a, b, c}. The 2-permutations of S are the ordered arrangements
a, b; a, c; b, a; b, c; c, a; and c, b. Consequently, there are six 2-permutations of this set
with three elements. There are always six 2-permutations of a set with three elements. There
are three ways to choose the first element of the arrangement. There are two ways to choose the
second element of the arrangement, because it must be different from the first element. Hence,
by the product rule, we see that P(3, 2) = 3 * 2 = 6. the first element. By the product rule, it
follows that P(3, 2) = 3 * 2 = 6.

We now use the product rule to find a formula for P(n, r) whenever n and r are positive integers
with 1 ≤ r ≤ n.

THEOREM: If n is a positive integer and r is an integer with 1 ≤ r ≤ n, then there are
P(n, r) = n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · (n − r + 1)
r-permutations of a set with n distinct elements.

COROLLARY: If n and r are integers with 0 ≤ r ≤ n, then P(n, r) = n! / (n − r)! 


Permutations with repetition:

How many strings of length r can be formed from the uppercase letters of the English alphabet?

Solution: By the product rule, because there are 26 uppercase English letters, and because each
letter can be used repeatedly, we see that there are 26^r strings of uppercase English letters of
length r.

THEOREM: The number of r-permutations of a set of n objects with repetition allowed is n^r
