In a version of the computer language BASIC, the name of a variable is a string of one or
two alphanumeric characters, where uppercase and lowercase letters are not distinguished. (An
alphanumeric character is either one of the 26 English letters or one of the 10 digits.) Moreover,
a variable name must begin with a letter and must be different from the five strings of two
characters that are reserved for programming use. How many different variable names are there
in this version of BASIC?

Solution: Let V equal the number of different variable names in this version of BASIC. Let V1
be the number of these that are one character long and V2 be the number of these that are two
characters long. Then by the sum rule, V = V1 + V2. Note that V1 = 26, because a one-character
variable name must be a letter. Furthermore, by the product rule there are 26 * 36 strings of length
two that begin with a letter and end with an alphanumeric character. However, five of these
are excluded, so V2 = 26 * 36 âˆ’ 5 = 931. Hence, there are V = V1 + V2 = 26 + 931 = 957
different names for variables in this version of BASIC.
