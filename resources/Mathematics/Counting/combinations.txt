How many different committees of three students can be formed from a group of four students?

Solution: To answer this question, we need only find the number of subsets with three elements
from the set containing the four students. We see that there are four such subsets, one for
each of the four students, because choosing three students is the same as choosing one of the
four students to leave out of the group. This means that there are four ways to choose the
three students for the committee, where the order in which these students are chosen does not
matter.

THEOREM: The number of r-combinations of a set with n elements, where n is a nonnegative integer and
r is an integer with 0 ≤ r ≤ n, equals

C(n, r) = n! / (r!*(n − r)!)


Combinations with Repetition:

How many ways are there to select four pieces of fruit from a bowl containing apples, oranges,
and pears if the order in which the pieces are selected does not matter, only the type of fruit and
not the individual piece matters, and there are at least four pieces of each type of fruit in the
bowl?

Solution: To solve this problem we list all the ways possible to select the fruit. There are 15
ways:

4 apples						4 oranges 						4 pears
3 apples, 1 orange				3 apples, 1 pear 				3 oranges, 1 apple
3 oranges, 1 pear 				3 pears, 1 apple 				3 pears, 1 orange
2 apples, 2 oranges 			2 apples, 2 pears 				2 oranges, 2 pears
2 apples, 1 orange, 1 pear 		2 oranges, 1 apple, 1 pear 		2 pears, 1 apple, 1 orange

The solution is the number of 4-combinations with repetition allowed from a three-element set,
{apple, orange, pear}.

THEOREM: There are C(n + r − 1, r) = C(n + r − 1, n − 1) r-combinations from a set with n elements
when repetition of elements is allowed.

(n + r − 1)! / (r!*(n − 1)!)
