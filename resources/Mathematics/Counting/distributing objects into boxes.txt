Many counting problems can be solved by enumerating theways objects can be placed into boxes
(where the order these objects are placed into the boxes does not matter).

DISTINGUISHABLE OBJECTS AND DISTINGUISHABLE BOXES:

How many ways are there to distribute hands of 5 cards to each of four players from the standard
deck of 52 cards?

Solution:We will use the product rule to solve this problem. To begin, note that the first player
can be dealt 5 cards in C(52, 5) ways. The second player can be dealt 5 cards in C(47, 5) ways,
because only 47 cards are left. The third player can be dealt 5 cards in C(42, 5) ways. Finally,
the fourth player can be dealt 5 cards in C(37, 5) ways. Hence, the total number of ways to deal
four players 5 cards each is

C(52, 5)C(47, 5)C(42, 5)C(37, 5) = (52!/(47!*5!))*(47!/(42!*5!))*(42!/(37!*5!))*(37!/(32!*5!)) = 52!/(5!*5!*5!*5!*32!)

Remark: The solution to Example 8 equals the number of permutations of 52 objects, with 5 indistinguishable
objects of each of four different types, and 32 objects of a fifth type. The cards not dealt to any player correspond to cards in the positions assigned
to objects of the fifth type.

THEOREM: The number of ways to distribute n distinguishable objects into k distinguishable boxes so
that ni objects are placed into box i, i = 1, 2, . . . , k, equals
n! / (n1!*n2!* · · nk!)


INDISTINGUISHABLE OBJECTS AND DISTINGUISHABLE BOXES:

How many ways are there to place 10 indistinguishable balls into eight distinguishable bins?

Solution: The number of ways to place 10 indistinguishable balls into eight bins equals the number
of 10-combinations from a set with eight elements when repetition is allowed. Consequently,
there are

C(8 + 10 − 1, 10) = C(17, 10) = 17!/(10!*7!) = 19,448

This means that there are C(n + r − 1, n − 1) ways to place r indistinguishable objects
into n distinguishable boxes.


DISTINGUISHABLE OBJECTS AND INDISTINGUISHABLE BOXES:

How many ways are there to put four different employees into three indistinguishable offices,
when each office can contain any number of employees?

There is no simple closed formula for the number of ways to distribute n distinguishable
objects into j indistinguishable boxes. However, there is a formula involving a summation.

Let S(n, j ) denote the number of ways to distribute n distinguishable
objects into j indistinguishable boxes so that no box is empty. The numbers S(n, j ) are
called Stirling numbers of the second kind. For instance, Example 10 shows that S(4, 3) = 6,
S(4, 2) = 7, and S(4, 1) = 1. We see that the number of ways to distribute n distinguishable
objects into k indistinguishable boxes (where the number of boxes that are nonempty equals k,
k − 1, . . . , 2, or 1) equals	SUM from k to j=1 => S(n, j ).

How many ways are there to pack six copies of the same book into four identical boxes, where
a box can contain as many as six books?

Solution:We will enumerate all ways to pack the books. For each way to pack the books, we will
list the number of books in the box with the largest number of books, followed by the numbers
of books in each box containing at least one book, in order of decreasing number of books in a
box. The ways we can pack the books are
6
5, 1
4, 2
4, 1, 1
3, 3
3, 2, 1
3, 1, 1, 1
