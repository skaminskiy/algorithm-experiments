The Fibonacci heap data structure serves a dual purpose. First, it supports a set of
operations that constitutes what is known as a “mergeable heap.” Second, several
Fibonacci-heap operations run in constant amortized time, which makes this data
structure well suited for applications that invoke these operations frequently.

From a theoretical standpoint, Fibonacci heaps are especially desirable when the
number of EXTRACT-MIN and DELETE operations is small relative to the number
of other operations performed. This situation arises in many applications.

From a practical point of view, however, the constant factors and programming
complexity of Fibonacci heaps make them less desirable than ordinary binary
(or k-ary) heaps for most applications, except for certain applications that manage
large amounts of data. Thus, Fibonacci heaps are predominantly of theoretical interest.
If a much simpler data structure with the same amortized time bounds as
Fibonacci heaps were developed, it would be of practical use as well.
